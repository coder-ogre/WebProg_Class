  Here's link to take you home if you're tired of this page and all of it's spaces already<p text-align: center><a href="http://webprog.cs.ship.edu/webprog12"><img src="http://payload278.cargocollective.com/1/0/19261/7876182/fc_link.jpg" width=50% height=50% style="float: right;"></img></p></a></p>

  <p>Still here?  All the way to the middle of the page?  You're a trooper.  Especially since we didn't have to do all of that.  We could have just <span style="font-size: 30px"><em>teleported</em></span> to the middle of the page by changing the style tag to use a text-align of center, like this: </p>
  <p style="text-align: center; position: relative; top: 160px;">BOOM!</p>
  
  <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://rs523.pbsrc.com/albums/w356/unkadug/explosion-1.gif~c200" alt="Well hello there, this is in case you didn't see that awesome picture of the explosion.  Poor chap.  Have a candy bar."></img></p>
  
  
  <p>aaaaand now you've just killed yourself, and've become a clone.  Great, let's continue with some lists in a table, because clones love lists inside of tables!</p>
